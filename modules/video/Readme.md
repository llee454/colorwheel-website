Video Module Readme
===================

The video module defines blocks that can be used to
embed videos within HTML templates.

The module uses the VideoJS library to enable HTML5
video elements within browsers that do not natively
support the element.

When loaded, the module loads the VideoJS libraries
and CSS files and initializes any video elements
that have been nested within a video_player_block
element. 

An example demonstrating how the video_player_block
can be used is provided in /templates/
example_block.html.

More information about the VideoJS library can be
found here: https://github.com/videojs/video.js.
